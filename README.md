# Mentor App Coursework

This repository is for Part 2 of the COMP2013 coursework, the
mentor scheme app. It has already been set up with some skeleton
code including an implementation of the model.

All code for the app should be created under the
`uk.ac.nott.cs.comp2013.mentorapp` package. Use appropriate
sub-packages to organise the code well. Application code goes
under `src/main/java` and tests go under `src/test/java`.

## Starting the coursework

Fork this repository in the same way you did with first year
Programming and Algorithms. You may modify any of the provided
classes if you believe you need to do so.
