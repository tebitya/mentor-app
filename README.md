# Mentor App Coursework

This repository is for Part 2 of the COMP2013 coursework, the
mentor scheme app. It has already been set up with some skeleton
code including an implementation of the model.

All code for the app should be created under the
`uk.ac.nott.cs.comp2013.mentorapp` package. Use appropriate
sub-packages to organise the code well. Application code goes
under `src/main/java` and tests go under `src/test/java`.

## Starting the coursework

1. Fork this repository into your own user space, like you did
   in PGA.
2. In the IntelliJ launch window, instead of starting a new project
   select "Get from VCS."
3. Enter the URL of your personal repository and a Gitlab personal
   access token in place of your password.
4. When the project opens, verify that you can successfully build
   the project.
5. Start work!

## Framework

The provided code is there to help you get started. If you believe
it is necessary you may modify or add to this structure, but you
will need to justify this in the report.

If you identify an actual bug somewhere in the provided code, you
can raise an issue on the original repository and Ian will
respond to it.
